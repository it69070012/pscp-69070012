# Problem Solving Submission
## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
3996 - [LEARNING LOGS] สลับตัวอักษร
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
541536
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
0-15 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
The problem asks me to read one integer and decide whether it is even or odd.

Input:
The program receives one integer n.

Output:
The program should print "Even" if n is divisible by 2. Otherwise, it should print "Odd".

Constraints:
The input is an integer. I should also consider 0 and negative numbers because modulo still works with them in Python.
```

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
Step 1: Read integer n
Step 2: Check whether n % 2 == 0
Step 3: If true, print "Even"
Step 4: Otherwise, print "Odd"

Before asking my friend, I already knew that I should use modulo, but I was not sure whether negative numbers should be tested.
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
My final approach is the same as my first plan. I used the modulo operator to check the remainder when n is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd. I also tested zero and a negative number by myself after my friend reminded me that edge cases are useful.
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
This is a normal positive even number.
```

Input:

```text
4
```

Expected output:

```text
Even
```

Actual output:

```text
Even
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2

Why I chose this case:

```text
This checks zero because zero is a special value but should still be even.
```

Input:

```text
0
```

Expected output:

```text
Even
```

Actual output:

```text
Even
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 3

Why I chose this case:

```text
This checks a negative odd number.
```

Input:

```text
-3
```

Expected output:

```text
Odd
```

Actual output:

```text
Odd
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

## 6. AI Use

Did you use AI for this problem?

```text
No
```

If yes, also complete:

```text
ai_reflection.md
```

If you only asked a friend, TA, or instructor and did not use AI, you do not need to complete `ai_reflection.md`.

---

## 7. Human Help / Collaboration

Did you ask a friend, TA, instructor, or another person for help on this problem?

```text
Yes
```

If yes, briefly explain what kind of help you received.

Allowed examples:

- explanation of the problem statement
- explanation of a programming concept
- hint about the approach
- debugging discussion
- test-case discussion
- help understanding an error message

Not allowed:

- copying another person's code
- submitting another person's solution
- asking another person to write the solution for you
- using another person's OJ submission
- asking another person to submit to the OJ for you

Who helped you?

```text
A classmate.
```

What did they help with?

```text
They reminded me that I should test edge cases such as 0 and negative numbers. They did not write code for me.
```

What did you still do by yourself?

```text
I wrote the code, chose the final test cases, ran the program in VS Code, and submitted to the OJ by myself.
```

Did you copy any code from another person?

```text
No
```
